Web Development
----------------
3 building blocks of the web:-

1) HTML - Web scripting language, to create the skeleton of the web page
2) CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - Gives style to a basic HTML page to make it more beautiful and appealing.
3) Javascript - Is a programming language, it is required to perform logical and mathematical operations.

What is HTML ?
---------------
- HTML is a standard markup language for creating web pages.
- HTML stands for : Hyper Text Markup language
- describes the skeletal structure of the webpage.
- it consists of series of elements or tags
- These elements tells the browser how to show the contents on the web page 
- HTML elements label pieces of contents such as (Header):<h1></h1>, (Header 2) <h2></h2>, (Paragraph) <p></p>, (list) <li></li>, (unordered list) <ul></ul>, (links) <a></a>

<!DOCTYPE html> -> Defines that this document is an HTML5 document | '!' in Programming or CS we call this as Shebang operator !!


DOM Tree in HTML (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)
----------------------------------------
Whenever a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the pages.
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of objects.
                            

                              <title>        <a>   <h1>
                                 \             \   /                                      
                                <head>        <body> 
                                      \      /
                                       <html>

1. HTML Documents
---------------

Any doc written in HTML scripting language is an HTML document
They all should start with <!DOCTYPE HTML> : This signifies that the doc is written in HTML
The starting point of this document is the <HTML></HTML>

Q) What is the visible part of the document ? 
Between <Body> and </Body>

for. ex: 

--------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
----------------------------------------------------


2. <!DOCTYPE>
---------------
 This helps browser to display webpages correctly by knowing the type of document.

 Note : 1) Use it only one in a web page
        2) Is not case sensitive (u can use upper case or lower case or mixed case)


3. HTML Headings
------------------
HTML headings are defined with the <H1> to <H6> tags.
- <H1> or <h1>
- <H2> or <h2>
- <H3> or <h3>
- <H4> or <h4>

- <H6> or <h6>

4. HTML Paragraphs
--------------------
Theese are defined with the <p> tag:
ex:
<p> This is a paragraph. </p>
<p> This is another paragraph </p>

5. HTML Links or Anchor tags
------------------------------
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:

Format: <a href="https://github.com/anica18">My Github Profile</a>

-> href : It is an attribute for the <a> tag
-> HTTPS : Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (Secure)

-> What are attribures ? 
Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
For ex: the href attribute provides an info regarding which webpage should be referred when the text inside the <a> tag is clicked.

6) HTML Images
---------------
-> HTML images are defined with the <img> tags.
-> This tag has 4 important attributes :
      1) src = Path of the images
      2) alt = This is an alternate text which describes the image in case the page isn't loading
      3) width = width of the image (pixel)
      4) height = height of the image (pixel)

*Pixel - Picture Element

Imaegs and their Format :
--------------------------
1) JPEG/ JPG - Joint Photographic Expert Group Images (.jpeg or .jpg)
2) PNG - Portable Network Graphics (.png)
3) SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg)
4) WebP - Web Picture Format (.webp)


HTML ELEMENTS 
--------------
--------------

An HTML Element is defined by a start tag, some content and an end tags.

1) Start tag  : <tagname>
2) Some Content : Content goes here ....
3) End Tag : </tagname>

<tagname> Content goes here ... </tagname>

Ex:
<h1> My First Heading </h1>
<p> My first paragraph </p>


Line Break (EMPTY ELEMENT)
-------------------------

<br> : For adding a new line.
-> No end tag
-> No content

NOTE : Some HTML elements have no content and they do not have any end tag as well, These elements are known as EMPTY ELEMENTS
-----

Ex. <br>, <img>
in the latest HTML coding standards we write empty tags as : <emptytag />
Hence : <br /> and <img />


NESTED HTML ELEMENT

Q) Do all HTML documents contain nested HTML elements ?
-YES

Q) What is the root element of HTML Documents ?
-HTML

Q) What does Body element in HTML document show ?
- It contains all the visible parts in the Web page

WARNING !! 
----------
Never Skip the end tags. It will give u unexpected results

Note : <p> tag would work fine even if u miss the end tags.
------
But u should not rely on this and make sure to put an end tag nevertheless.


HTML IS NOT CASE SENSITIVE 
--------------------------
Html tags are not case sensitive : <P> is same as <p>

- As a good coding practise it is recommended to use lowercase in HTML.



HTML Attributes
------------------

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
For ex: the href attribute provides an info regarding which webpage should be referred when the text inside the <a> tag is clicked.

- All HTML elements can have attributes
- Additonal info abt elements
- It is always defined in the starting tag : ex. <img src="one.jpg" alt="test image" width="100" height="100" />
                                                 <a href="https://github.com/anica18"> Github Page </a>
- All the atrributes come in name/value pairs 
            name="value"


SRC Atrribute in <img>
-----------------------
There are 2 ways to specify the URL(or path) of the image in the src attribute :

1) Absolute Path (URL) - Link to an external image (which is hosted on another webpage)
Ex: src="https://www.abc.com/images/hill.jpg"

2) Relative Path (URL): Links to an image that is available in the current machine (or hosted on the same website)
Example: src="image.image2/1.jpg"

Recommended
------------
Relative! Why ? - They will not break even if the webpage changes


STYLE ATTRIBUTES

-------------------
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size and more

Syntax:
-------
<tagname style="property:value;">
Property : CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is CSS property
